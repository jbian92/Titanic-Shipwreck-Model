# Titanic Shipwreck Model
This model was created during Execute Big's Tech Roulette Week 2. It uses machine learning and Kaggle's Titanic data set. 

## Background Information
On April 15, 1912, the Titanic, a passenger liner widely considered "unsinkable," sank in the North Atlantic Ocean after colliding with an iceberg. Due to the lack of lifeboats, more than 1,500 out of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew died. Among the survivors, there seems to be many similarities. 

## What the Titanic Shipwreck Model Does
This model can predict whether a certain person, given a variety of inputs, would've survived the Titanic shipwreck.

## Execute Big's Tech Roulette Week 2
- Learned the basics of how to use Google Colab
- Gained knowledge on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and supervised learning
- Followed a tutorial to build a working model for the city of Roulettiopia by using a small, fake data set
- Used what I learned from the tutorial to create this model, which predicts the survival of passengers on the Titanic ship
